/*This scenario considers a desk lamp with adjustable brightness controlled by a button
when the button is pressed and released, it toggles the state of the LED (on or off). 
When the button is held down, it gradually increases the brightness of the LED using PWM.
To make the LED dim again the button needs to be continually held down.*/
